# Andromeda Galaxy (M31) Magnetic Field Study

This repository contains the analysis and tools developed for studying the magnetic field of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). The project explores correlations between the magnetic field and key physical parameters, including:

- **CO Emission**: Tracing molecular gas content.
- **Star Formation Rate (SFR)**: Investigating the role of magnetic fields in star formation.
- **Total Gas and HI Gas**: Understanding the dynamics of atomic and molecular gas.
- **Conversion Factor**: Deriving relationships between total gas and CO maps.

## Features

- **Google Colab Notebooks**: All analyses and visualizations are developed in Google Colab for ease of use and accessibility.
- **Data Processing and Visualization**: Tools for handling M31 data and creating detailed correlation plots.
- **Magnetic Field Studies**: Investigation of the magnetic field's impact on gas dynamics and star formation.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Google Colab notebooks for all stages of the analysis, including data loading, processing, and visualization.
- `results/`: Output files, including correlation plots and processed data.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Google account to access Google Colab.
- Basic understanding of Python and astrophysical datasets.

### Running the Analysis on Google Colab
1. Open the relevant notebook in the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Upload your data files to the Colab runtime or connect Colab to Google Drive for seamless file access.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to perform the analysis.

### Example
To compute correlations between CO and SFR:
1. Open the `M31_CO_SFR_Correlation.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the required FITS files or link your Google Drive.
3. Run the notebook cells to generate correlation plots and statistical analyses.
